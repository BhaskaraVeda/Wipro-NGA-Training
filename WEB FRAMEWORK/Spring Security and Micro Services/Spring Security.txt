Spring Security : It is one of the module provide by spring framework

It is mainly about two things:

- Authentication : Just to check who you are? You have logged in or you have the credentials to login (the credentials , google , facebook(OAuth))
- Authorization : What are you allowed to do after login ? (role / access control )
 
In spring boot app, Spring security sits in front of your controller as a filter and decides :
Is the user logged in?
Do they have the right role?
Should we allow this request or block it?
 
Types of security

Form Login + session based cookies
Classic web app (Login page, session ( HTTP Session / Cookie, CSRF Protection)
CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of cyberattack where a malicious website, email, blog, or instant message tricks a user's web browser into performing an unwanted action on a trusted site where the user is currently authenticated. 
 
Http Basic :
Username/password sent with every request in header
Good for quick testing
 
JWT Authentication / Token Based (Stateless)
Client logs in once, and gets a JWT token
Sends token on every request in Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Server does not use HTTP sessions.

 Question 4
Marks: 1/1

Equal character in string
You are given a string s. In one move you can change any character to another character.
You have to make a string which consists of the same character. 
Find the minimum move to do this task.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000

s consists only of lowercase characters .

Input Format

First line contains string s.

Output format 

Print the minimum move to this task.

 Input

aabbbcccc

output

5

Explanation

Since  character ‘c’ has maximum frequency in string s. So we will make all other characters
to ‘c’so the minimum move is 5 (convert 2 ‘a’ into ‘c’ and 3 ‘b’into ‘c’).
